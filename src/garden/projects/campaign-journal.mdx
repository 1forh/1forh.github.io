Campaign Journal let's keep track of Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. Whether you just want to take notes for your weekly campaigns or you want to produce grand stories that tell of your heroes' adventures, Campaign Journal can help!

Each campaign is broken up into journals and entries. Journals are like different chapters of your campaign. Journal entries are individual stories that make up a journal.

## Public Campaigns

You can set your campaigns to public so that anyone can view them and read your stories. Set them back to private if you'd like to keep them to yourself.
