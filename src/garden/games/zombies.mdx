This game was built following along with the [**RPG Core Combat Creator: Learn Intermediate Unity C# Coding**](https://www.udemy.com/course/unityrpg/) course on Udemy. I've only finished a few of the sections so far but it's coming along.

The plan is to turn this into a zombie survival game with features such as gathering, equipment, actual zombies, different areas to explore, and more!
