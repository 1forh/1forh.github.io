Bootstrap is my choice of framework when it comes to front-end development. While developing my websites and applications, I use the Bootstrap grid to setup my layout. In order to quickly check how my site is looking compared to the grid, I created the [Bootstrap Grid Overlay Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bootstrap-grid-overlay/mnlklmelflkheijccafopdohgclfefcg).

With the Bootstrap Grid Overlay Chrome extension, I can quickly toggle an overlay of the Bootstrap grid. The overlay uses the styles directly from my application so there is no need for me to configure anything.

To toggle the Bootstrap Grid Overlay, all I have to do is click on the Chrome extension icon in my browser's toolbar.

## Making things even easier

In order to toggle the overlay even quicker, Chrome allows a user to assign a keybind to a Chrome extension.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on Keyboard shortcuts
3. Find Bootstrap Grid Overlay and assign your keybind
