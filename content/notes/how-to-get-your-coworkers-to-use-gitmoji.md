## What is Gitmoji

[Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) is pretty dope. Put simply, it's a standard for using emojis in your commit messages.

Removing a file or a `console.log`? Add a 🔥 emoji to the beginning of your commit message. Fixed a layout bug in Safari? Add a 🐛 emoji. Added some sweet styles for that new Copy with Media component? Add a 💄 emoji.

So easy. So effective. Another developer can review your pull request and gain a lot of context just by scanning your commit messages before diving deeper.

## The Steps

1.  Start using Gitmoji yourself. Add an emoji to the beginning of each of your commits. You gotta set a good example and use it in every commit. Don't mess this up!
2.  Make sure you send a link to [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) in Slack a few times as a subtle hint to your coworkers.

3.  Say good things about it so your coworkers feel like they're missing out.
4.  When your boss asks what the point is, tell him/her "emojis = happy developers = 💰"
5.  By now you probably have the whole office using it. Nice work. 👍
