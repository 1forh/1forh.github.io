It's easy and understandable to feel this way about a job where you're exposed to angry, stressed-out, and hurried people all day.

The thing is, the only reason someone might feel this way is because they are looking back at all of the other times in their past that a customer has been "stupid" or annoying or pissed off. 

Even if this is the first time it has happened today, they remember all of the other times and that is exhausting because this negativity just piles up and up.

> Don't let these motherfuckers tell you how you're supposed to feel. No, it's day one motherfucker. It's hour one. <br /> - David Goggins

This quote helps me so much when I'm on a long run. I get in my own head, thinking about how tired I am, how far I've already ran and how far I have to run to be done for the day. I'm causing myself suffering by thinking of my past and thinking of my future.

Then I hear David Goggins in my mind yelling at me to "stay hard" and I remember this quote of his. I gain a shift in perspective and that brings me out of my negative thinking and into the present moment. I instantly feel stronger, more alive, calmer, and happier, even in the middle of the toughest runs. 

When I get out of my own head, stay present in the moment, and remember that the past is the past and the future is the future and none of that fucking matters right now, I feel peace and I feel like I can run for days. It's always the first minute of the run. Always. 

So, if you're ever having a tough day and you feel like the task or the work is insurmountable, just remember that there is only this moment. Forget about the past and forget about the future. The only tough day you've ever had is today and you can get through it. I promise.

Thanks for the words of wisdom, Goggins. Stay hard!
