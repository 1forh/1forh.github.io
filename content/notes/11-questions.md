title: 11 Questions
summary: My answers to the 11 questions from Tribe of Mentors by Tim Ferris
---

**What is the book (or books) you’ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?**

**What purchase of \$100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.**

**How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a “favorite failure” of yours?**

**If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it — metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions — what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If helpful, it can be someone else’s quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live your life by?)**

**What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)**

**What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?**

**In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?**

I purchased [Why Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment](https://www.audible.com/pd/Why-Buddhism-Is-True-Audiobook/B073XSBD8Z?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=592f90bd-7f7b-4bfc-afa2-b002e52e7228&pf_rd_r=AXHK1Y6Q4AGRH87MY81T) on June 10th, 2018. Since then, I have started a meditation practice, learned more about Buddhism, and attempted to practice what I've learned daily.

I started waking up at 5:30 am every single day. Every day, [Jocko Willink](https://twitter.com/jockowillink) posts a photo of his watch at 4:45 am. _Get after it_. Every day I get up, post a photo of my watch, go for a run, meditate. Waking up early gives me time to get the things done that I want to do (or don't want to do sometimes), and breath a little before going into the [office](https://www.skycatchfire.com).

**What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the “real world”? What advice should they ignore?**

**What are some bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?**

**In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?**

**When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)**

Take a walk or go for a run, meditate
