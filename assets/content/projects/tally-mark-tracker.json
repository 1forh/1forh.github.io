  "body": "Track your push-ups, squats, pull-ups, or anything with this simple tracking app! Tally Mark Tracker allows users to create whatever items they want to track and drag and drop the items to sort them.\n\nTally Mark Tracker utilizes [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/configuration), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), and [vuex-persistedstate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex-persistedstate). vuex-persistedstate saves the Vuex store in local storage so the user doesn't lose any tally marks they've tracked when the page is refreshed."
